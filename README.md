Lexical analyzer for the SR programming language.
The 'practice_1.py' file reads the data from the 'data' folder to identify the
operator tokens, reserved words and regular expressions that will be useful to 
identify the lexemes of the files analyzed in the SR language.
The files to test the operation of the program are in the 'test' folder.
When executing the program, it requests the name of a file located in the test 
folder and generates a new one with the same name but with the terminal 
'\_alz.txt' where the result of the lexical analysis is stored.
